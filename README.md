# Poker Bankroll Tracking Program (MAJOR Work in Progress)
I have mostly created this page as a placeholder for when the project is complete for now, but parts of the GUI and file I/O are functional so I'm adding it now. Eventually,
users will be able to add sessions, view their previous sessions, view a report of all of their sessions (with possible filters), and view a graph of their bankroll. Here are
some preliminary screenshots:\
